- There  are many resources the plan is to watch few tutorials, read some guide and start to understand what I want to put into the code. I wish to focus on the error handling side.

## 02/10/2018 to 04/10/208
Wrote my notes about socket programming 

## 05/10/2018 Still trying to grasp what I should do
Start to chop down some code: 
</br>
The plan for the asignment: 

![](https://www.tenouk.com/Module39_files/image008.png)

### UDP Client:</br>
- Create UDP socket.
- Send message to server.
- Wait until response from server is recieved.
- Close socket descriptor and exit.

### UDP Server:</br>
- Create UDP socket.
- instantiates a new server structure that holds the properties of our server;
- creates a socket and makes it passive with server_listen`;
- Bind the socket to server address.
- Wait until datagram packet arrives from client.
- accepts new connections on the server socket.
- Process the datagram packet and send a reply to client.

## 09/10/2018 Struct problems  
After reading and reading, I finally came to the conclusion of which struct to use. Things i need to check:
- [ ] how to make a Makefile
- [x] Error Handling </br>
The C programming language provides [perror() and strerror()](https://www.studytonight.com/c/error-handling-in-c.php) functions which can be used to display the text message associated with errno.
    -  The perror() function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.
    - The strerror() function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.
    
    ```C
     void die(char *s)
     {
        perror(s);
        exit(1);
      }
    ```

- [simple UDP client/server system in a C/Unix environment](https://www.abc.se/%7Em6695/udp.html)

## 11/10/2018 Finding solutions
Finally it works, the problem was that I need to use write instead of sendto. From here should be easy to implement the different clients. 
To recap: 
- the server is agnostic ipv4 and ipv6
- the if statement are optimized using __builtin_except  (thing that i will be back on this)
- everything seems to work fine.

- [to check the connection on the terminal](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/how-to-check-all-open-tcp-connections-790895/)
```Bash
netstat -anp --udp
```
Now I need to implement the [timer](https://linux.die.net/man/3/clock_gettime) and the timeout using [select](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html)

### 18/10/2018 RIFF Day
The WAVE file format is a subset of Microsoft's RIFF specification for the storage of multimedia files. A RIFF file starts out with a file header followed by a sequence of data chunks. A WAVE file is often just a RIFF file with a single "WAVE" chunk which consists of two sub-chunks -- a "fmt " chunk specifying the data format and a "data" chunk containing the actual sample data. Call this form the "Canonical form". Who knows how it really all works. An almost complete description which seems totally useless unless you want to spend a week looking over it can be found at MSDN (mostly describes the non-PCM, or registered proprietary data formats). 
![](http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/wav-sound-format.gif)

```Bash
The canonical WAVE format starts with the RIFF header:

0         4   ChunkID          Contains the letters "RIFF" in ASCII form
                               (0x52494646 big-endian form).
4         4   ChunkSize        36 + SubChunk2Size, or more precisely:
                               4 + (8 + SubChunk1Size) + (8 + SubChunk2Size)
                               This is the size of the rest of the chunk 
                               following this number.  This is the size of the 
                               entire file in bytes minus 8 bytes for the
                               two fields not included in this count:
                               ChunkID and ChunkSize.
8         4   Format           Contains the letters "WAVE"
                               (0x57415645 big-endian form).

The "WAVE" format consists of two subchunks: "fmt " and "data":
The "fmt " subchunk describes the sound data's format:

12        4   Subchunk1ID      Contains the letters "fmt "
                               (0x666d7420 big-endian form).
16        4   Subchunk1Size    16 for PCM.  This is the size of the
                               rest of the Subchunk which follows this number.
20        2   AudioFormat      PCM = 1 (i.e. Linear quantization)
                               Values other than 1 indicate some 
                               form of compression.
22        2   NumChannels      Mono = 1, Stereo = 2, etc.
24        4   SampleRate       8000, 44100, etc.
28        4   ByteRate         == SampleRate * NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8
32        2   BlockAlign       == NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8
                               The number of bytes for one sample including
                               all channels. I wonder what happens when
                               this number isn't an integer?
34        2   BitsPerSample    8 bits = 8, 16 bits = 16, etc.
          2   ExtraParamSize   if PCM, then doesn't exist
          X   ExtraParams      space for extra parameters

The "data" subchunk contains the size of the data and the actual sound:

36        4   Subchunk2ID      Contains the letters "data"
                               (0x64617461 big-endian form).
40        4   Subchunk2Size    == NumSamples * NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8
                               This is the number of bytes in the data.
                               You can also think of this as the size
                               of the read of the subchunk following this 
                               number.
44        *   Data             The actual sound data.

```

## 11/11/2018 Writing a shell 
A new assignment coming in, I need to do a shell in C. Awesome!! 
It has to support what most of shells support, including running processes in bg, detaching ... 
First thing  first, [this](http://www.lostsaloon.com/technology/how-to-detach-process-from-the-terminal-in-linux/) awesome link about detaching. There is this handy dandy [Tutorial - Write a Shell in CStephen Brennan ](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) that need to be read. Then, I guess I need to read about [pipes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pipe-system-call/), [fork()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/) and seems I need this book
[Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment, 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Programming-UNIX-Environment-Edition/dp/0321637739) someone wrote [this](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-tutorials-for-writing-a-shell-in-C) on quora: 
```xml
The really tricky part of your assignment isn't parsing - it's process management.  Read APUE Chapter 8 (Process Control). Read it again. Write a program that:

    fork()s a new process,
    exec()s the /bin/echo program with the two arguments "Hello" and "world!",
    wait()s for the child process to complete, then
    returns the result from wait().
```

#### Fork()
On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child. On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child process is created, and errno is set appropriately. 
```

pipe() creates a pipe, a unidirectional data channel that can be used for interprocess communication. The array pipefd is used to return two file descriptors referring to the ends of the pipe. pipefd[0] refers to the read end of the pipe. pipefd[1] refers to the write end of the pipe.
- fd[0] = read file descriptor
- fd[1] = wrtie file descriptor
```
Name
pipe, pipe2 - create pipe
Synopsis

#include <unistd.h>
int pipe(int pipefd[2]);
#define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */#include
<fcntl.h>              /* Obtain O_* constant definitions */#include <unistd.h>
int pipe2(int pipefd[2], int flags);
```

### 17/11/2018
[This](https://gist.github.com/fkt/5f8f9560ef54e11ff7df8bec09dc8f9a) repo gave me a good idea regarding signal handling.
```signal(SIGINT, handle_signal); ```
Another important explanation can be found in my OSjournal entry [process creation](https://github.com/H3xFiles/OperativeSystem_journal/blob/master/README.md#unix-process-creation)
The all process seems still something unclear, what I have understood is that the program need to do something like:

```C
pid = fork();

// parent process
if ( pid == 0 )
{
    execve(tmp[i], arg, env);

    // if you get here, execve() failed and you need
    // to be really careful because you're now running
    // a copy of the parent process - you can corrupt
    // files open in the parent, for example, because
    // data can be buffered in FILE * streams.

    // this is safe, though.  Note the underscore!
    // exit(0) without the underscore is *not* safe here
    _exit(0);
}
// child process
else if ( pid > ( pid_t ) 0 )
{
    wait(&pid);
}
else
{
    // fork() failed - handle error
}

return (0);
```
